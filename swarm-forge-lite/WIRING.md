# Wiring The Pack To A Project — Agent Runbook

**Audience:** an opencode agent acting for the operator. The operator has moved
`swarm-forge-lite/` next to a real project and points you at this file. Repoint
the harness yourself; the operator does not hand-edit JSON.

**Goal:** make `swarm-forge-lite/harness.json` resolve to the target project with
the operator's chosen persistent-test placement, then prove it with the harness
CLIs and the project's tests.

**One rule above all:** `harness.json` is the single source of truth. Every path
a tool or role uses comes from it. Never hardcode a path anywhere else.

---

## 0. TL;DR Agent Checklist

1. Ask the operator the five questions in §1. Do not guess.
2. Resolve the pack and project to absolute paths; decide the relative paths you
   write (§2, §4).
3. Edit `swarm-forge-lite/harness.json` (§3, §4). Keep `state_root`,
   `artifacts_root`, and `hot_tests` in the pack.
4. If the target persistent root does not exist, create it from the template in
   §5 (the pack's `project_tests/` already is that template).
5. Verify with `harness status` and `harness config` (§6). Every row must be
   `[ok]`.
6. Clean the shared areas before the first run (`harness clean all`).
7. Run the project's unit/property tests and the acceptance pipeline (§6).
8. Confirm no artifact, cache, or bytecode landed in the project tree (§7).
9. Report the resolved paths, the test results, and anything you could not
   resolve.

---

## 1. Ask The Operator First

Do not invent any of these. Use the `question` tool.

| Question | Why it matters | Default if the operator says "you decide" |
|---|---|---|
| What is the **target project directory**? | It becomes `workspace_root`. | A sibling of `swarm-forge-lite/`. |
| Should the **persistent tests live in the pack or in the project**? | Sets `persistent_tests[].root` and `features`. | In the pack (keeps the project tree test-free). |
| What is the **source root** (where the project's code lives)? | Becomes `source_roots`; quality tools scan it. | `<project>/src`. |
| Where are the project's **existing tests/features**, if any? | Reuse them instead of scaffolding new ones. | None — scaffold under the chosen root. |
| What **language/test runner** is the project? | §5 templates assume Python/pytest. | The pack default (Python). |

If the project already has a pytest persistent root, point
`persistent_tests[].root` at it instead of scaffolding.

---

## 2. How Paths Resolve (lite rules — read before editing)

These rules live in `swarm-forge-lite/tools/shared/wiring/` and are the only way
a port breaks.

- **Base directory.** Every path in `harness.json` resolves relative to the
  **directory that contains `harness.json`** — the pack root. `~` expands to the
  home directory. Absolute paths are used as-is. Every result is canonicalized.
- **The config.** The tools read `<pack>/harness.json`. There is **no upward
  walk**. `SWARM_CONFIG` (or an explicit `--config`) replaces that file;
  `SWARM_PACK` replaces the pack root. If resolution looks wrong, check for a
  stray `SWARM_*` variable first.
- **`persistent_tests` entries** are only `{root, kind}`. There is **no
  `pythonpath` field** in the lite config — imports are handled by the persistent
  root's own `pytest.ini` (§5).
- **`kind` is a label, not a selector.** `"harness"` marks the pack's own tests,
  `"project"` marks a wired project's tests. Nothing chooses a root by kind; both
  listed roots are used. (This differs from the retired `swarm-forge-tin` pack.)
- **Keep the disposable areas in the pack.** Unless the operator explicitly wants
  otherwise, leave these as the pack's shared areas so nothing lands in the
  project:

| Field | Keep it at | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `state_root` | `".swarmforge"` (pack) | durable task state |
| `artifacts_root` | `"dump"` (pack) | parse IR, dry reports, coverage, caches |
| `hot_tests` | `"hot_tests"` (pack) | generated acceptance entry points |

---

## 3. Field Reference

| Field | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `version` | yes | — | Always `1`. |
| `workspace_root` | yes | `..` | The project under work. |
| `state_root` | recommended | `.swarmforge` | Durable state; keep in the pack. |
| `artifacts_root` | recommended | `dump` | Reports and caches; keep in the pack. |
| `hot_tests` | recommended | `hot_tests` | Generated tests; keep in the pack. |
| `persistent_tests` | yes | `[]` | List of `{root, kind}`. |
| `source_roots` | yes | `["src"]` | Trees the quality tools scan. |
| `features` | recommended | none | The authored `.feature` root. |
| `roles` | no | see below | The pipeline roles; keep as-is. |

`persistent_tests[]` entry:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `root` | The persistent test root (contains `unit/`, `property/`, `features/`, `acceptance/`). |
| `kind` | `"project"` for a wired project, `"harness"` for the pack's own tests. |

The shipped `roles` list is
`["orchestrator", "specifier", "coder", "refactorer", "architect"]`.

---

## 4. Choose The Placement, Then Edit

Decide with the operator, then write one of the two shapes. In both, only
`workspace_root`, `source_roots`, `persistent_tests`, and `features` change; the
shared areas stay in the pack.

### Option A — persistent tests in the pack (recommended; project stays test-free)

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "workspace_root": "../myproject",
  "state_root": ".swarmforge",
  "artifacts_root": "dump",
  "hot_tests": "hot_tests",
  "persistent_tests": [
    { "root": "project_tests/persistent", "kind": "project" }
  ],
  "source_roots": ["../myproject/src"],
  "features": "project_tests/persistent/features",
  "roles": [
    "orchestrator",
    "specifier",
    "coder",
    "refactorer",
    "architect"
  ]
}
```

Path math (layout `work/myproject/`, `work/swarm-forge-lite/`):

- config dir = `work/swarm-forge-lite`
- `workspace_root` = `../myproject` → `work/myproject`
- `root` = `project_tests/persistent` → `work/swarm-forge-lite/project_tests/persistent`
- `source_roots` = `../myproject/src` → `work/myproject/src`
- `features` = `project_tests/persistent/features` → the pack's project feature root

The pack's `project_tests/` already ships the pytest root, conftest, acceptance
runtime, generator, runner, and an empty step registry — nothing to scaffold.

### Option B — persistent tests inside the project

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "workspace_root": "../myproject",
  "state_root": ".swarmforge",
  "artifacts_root": "dump",
  "hot_tests": "hot_tests",
  "persistent_tests": [
    { "root": "../myproject/tests/persistent", "kind": "project" }
  ],
  "source_roots": ["../myproject/src"],
  "features": "../myproject/tests/persistent/features",
  "roles": [
    "orchestrator",
    "specifier",
    "coder",
    "refactorer",
    "architect"
  ]
}
```

Path math:

- `root` = `../myproject/tests/persistent`
- `features` = `../myproject/tests/persistent/features`

In Option B the authored tests intentionally live in the project, but the
**disposable** areas still do not: `dump/`, `hot_tests/`, and `.swarmforge/` stay
in the pack, and the project-side pytest root must keep its caches in the pack
(§5). You must also copy the acceptance components (`runtime.py`, `generator.py`,
`run_acceptance.py`, `steps/`) into the project root, because `run_acceptance.py`
locates its siblings relative to itself.

### Absolute project paths

Relative paths survive moving the pack and project together. When the project is
not a sibling, absolute paths are valid:

```json
"workspace_root": "/srv/apps/myproject",
"source_roots": ["/srv/apps/myproject/src"],
"persistent_tests": [
  { "root": "/srv/apps/myproject/tests/persistent", "kind": "project" }
],
"features": "/srv/apps/myproject/tests/persistent/features"
```

Never mix a relative `root` with an absolute `pythonpath`-style value; always
confirm the result with `harness config`.

---

## 5. Create Or Adapt The Persistent Test Root

The pack's `project_tests/` is the working template. A persistent root is a
pytest root: it needs a `pytest.ini` and a `conftest.py`.

Layout:

```
<persistent root>/
├── pytest.ini
├── conftest.py
├── unit/          # TDD unit tests
├── property/      # hypothesis properties
├── features/      # authored Gherkin specs
└── acceptance/    # runtime + generator + runner + steps/
```

`pytest.ini` — the pack copy is:

```ini
[pytest]
testpaths = persistent
pythonpath = persistent
cache_dir = ../dump/pytest_cache-project
```

- `testpaths` points at the `persistent/` package from the pytest root.
- `pythonpath` must reach the project source so tests can import it.
- `cache_dir` must point into the pack's `dump/`, never the project. Without it
  pytest writes `.pytest_cache/` into the project tree — a leak. Do not add
  inline `;` comments to these lines; `pytest.ini` does not parse them.

`conftest.py` — keep bytecode and hypothesis state out of the project (the pack
copy sets both):

```python
import os
import sys
from pathlib import Path

sys.dont_write_bytecode = True

_dump_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent / "dump"
os.environ.setdefault(
    "HYPOTHESIS_STORAGE_DIRECTORY", str(_dump_dir / "hypothesis-project")
)
```

`project_tests/persistent/conftest.py` additionally loads `wiring` and puts
`workspace_root` on `sys.path`, so pack-side tests can import the project source
without a `pythonpath` entry.

Step handlers: `project_tests/persistent/acceptance/steps/__init__.py` ships an
empty `STEP_HANDLERS = []`. Add one module per feature area and concatenate its
`HANDLERS` there. The `gherkin-parser` and `ir-dry-checker` wrappers, and the
acceptance runtime/generator/runner, are reused from the pack; do not re-author
them.

---

## 6. Verify (do this before reporting done)

Run from the workspace root, in order.

```bash
# 1. Every path resolves and exists (exit 2 on a bad config)
python3 swarm-forge-lite/tools/shared/harness.py status

# 2. The resolved JSON, to check the persistent root and source roots
python3 swarm-forge-lite/tools/shared/harness.py config

# 3. Clean the shared areas before the first run of a new project
python3 swarm-forge-lite/tools/shared/harness.py clean all

# 4. The project's unit + property tests (from the chosen persistent root)
cd swarm-forge-lite/project_tests && PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m pytest

# 5. The project's acceptance pipeline (parse -> dry -> generate -> run)
python3 swarm-forge-lite/project_tests/persistent/acceptance/run_acceptance.py
```

Expected: `harness status` marks every row `[ok]`; the unit/property suites pass;
the acceptance pipeline exits 0. If the project has no tests yet, say so and
report the resolved paths instead of inventing tests.

`run_acceptance.py` reads features from `features`, parses each into
`artifacts_root/<stem>.json`, dry-checks into `artifacts_root/<stem>.dry.json`,
generates entry points into `hot_tests/acceptance/`, then runs them. It loads
wiring from `SWARM_CONFIG` or the pack's `harness.json`; pass
`SWARM_CONFIG` when you are using an alternate config.

---

## 7. Leak Check (the operator cares about this)

After running, confirm the project tree gained nothing disposable:

```bash
find ../myproject \( -name __pycache__ -o -name '*.pyc' -o -name .pytest_cache \
  -o -name .hypothesis -o -name .coverage \) -print
```

An empty result is the pass condition. If anything appears, the cause is one of:
a missing `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`, a `cache_dir` pointing into the project,
or a `conftest.py` that does not set `sys.dont_write_bytecode`. Fix the setup,
delete the stray files, and re-run.

---

## 8. Return To Self-Hosting

Before the pack is wired to any project it self-hosts. Restore these four fields
in `swarm-forge-lite/harness.json`, then clean:

```json
"workspace_root": "..",
"source_roots": ["tools"],
"persistent_tests": [
  { "root": "harness_tests/persistent", "kind": "harness" },
  { "root": "project_tests/persistent", "kind": "project" }
],
"features": "harness_tests/persistent/features"
```

```bash
python3 swarm-forge-lite/tools/shared/harness.py clean all
```

That is the entire switch: four fields in one file.

---

## 9. Switching Between Targets Without Editing (optional)

To keep two targets side by side, leave `harness.json` alone and add a second
config in the pack, e.g. `swarm-forge-lite/harness.myproject.json`. Select it
with `SWARM_CONFIG` or `--config`:

```bash
python3 swarm-forge-lite/tools/shared/harness.py \
  --config swarm-forge-lite/harness.myproject.json status
SWARM_CONFIG=swarm-forge-lite/harness.myproject.json \
  python3 swarm-forge-lite/project_tests/persistent/acceptance/run_acceptance.py
```

Clean the shared `hot_tests/` before switching, or the previous project's
generated entry points collide with the next.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `harness: cannot read config ...` | Bad path or malformed JSON | Fix `harness.json`; the error names the file. |
| A path resolves to the wrong place | A stray `SWARM_*` env var overrides the file | Unset `SWARM_CONFIG` / `SWARM_PACK`; check for an explicit `--config`. |
| Tests cannot import the project | `pytest.ini` `pythonpath` is wrong | Point it at the project source, from the persistent root. |
| Generated tests collide across projects | Shared `hot_tests/` holds the previous project's entry points | `harness clean hot` (or `all`) before switching. |
| `clean state` refuses | State items are locked | Only use force with operator confirmation. |
| `.pytest_cache`/`__pycache__` in the project | Missing cache/bytecode guards | See §5 and §7. |
| Acceptance needs a config | The runner cannot find one | Pass `SWARM_CONFIG` or `--config`. |
| APS tasks missing | Babashka (`bb`) is not installed | Install `bb`; APS-dependent checks skip without it. |

---

## 11. Boundaries

- Edit **only** `harness.json` (or add a new config in the pack). Do not edit the
  tools, the agent prompts, or the constitution to make a path work.
- Never write into the project's source roots. The project source stays
  test-free; only Option B's persistent root is authored inside the project.
- Never delete `swarm-forge-lite/harness_tests/persistent/` (the pack's own
  tests). `hot_tests/`, `dump/`, and `.swarmforge/` are disposable; the project
  tree is not.
- Prefer relative paths; they survive moving the pack and project together.
- After editing, always run `harness status` **and** `harness config` and read
  the resolved output before claiming the port is done.
- Report back: the config file you changed, the resolved `workspace_root` and
  persistent root, the placement chosen, and the test results.
