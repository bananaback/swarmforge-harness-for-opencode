"""wiring -- resolve harness paths from a harness.json config.

One config, one pack, two targets: the pack's own harness.json points the tools
at either the project under work or the harness itself. Every path resolves
relative to the config's directory.

The four actions live in one module each:

1. Find the config:  ``locator``  (``ConfigLocator`` / ``PackConfigLocator``)
2. Read it:          ``config``   (``ConfigFile``, ``parse_config``)
3. Resolve paths:    ``resolver`` (``PathResolver``)
4. Hand them out:    ``loader``   (``HarnessConfig``, ``load``)
